Analysis for Gated X-ray Framing Cameras

The spectral emission, detector response and ratiocurve is calculated with Ratiocurve_calculation.py
To process an X-ray image use ImageProcessing.py. This is currently setup for a CHCl OMEGA shot
Background removal performed with GPR_background.py which ImageProcessing.py imports.
